        <h2>Bio
            <p>My name is Colin Lauro and I am 18 years old. I am a freshman at New England Institute of Technology going for my bachelor's degree in CyberSecurity and Network Engineering. I have been interesting in technology from a young age and have always taken a special interest in video games. I spend any free time at disposal to sit down and relax while playing video games with my friends. This interest has sparked my passion to learn further in my studies of being a Cybersecurity and Network Engineering student at New England Institute of Technology. </p>
