        <p>Hi my name is colin and from a young age I found interest in a collection of a few things, these being video games, family and friends, animals, and science. These passions have always been of interest in my life and video games have had an inspiration of why I am majoring in cybersecurity as the passion for technology has been with me for most of my life. I have considered other fields for my majors inspired by my passions such as becoming a marine biologist due to my love for animals or going into pharmaceutical medicine as result of my passion for medicine and science. I knew cybersecurity was a great way for me to connect my passion for technology and apply it into my life, and I have seen that it is an amazing field to get into, as it is an ever-growing field and can cover my life financially.</p>
